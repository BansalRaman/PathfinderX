# Travel Planning Application

## Overview

The Travel Planning Application generates personalized travel itineraries based on user inputs, allowing users to quickly plan trips with customized suggestions. By leveraging machine learning, the app creates travel itineraries without depending on external APIs, offering users more control over their travel plans.

## Features

- Dynamic travel itinerary generation based on user preferences.
- Responsive form design using Material UI.
- Machine learning-based recommendations.
- No reliance on external travel APIs.
- Seamless user experience with integrated output display.
- Video background for an immersive experience.

## Architecture

This application is built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** stack:

- **Frontend (React)**: Provides the user interface (form and output) using Material UI for a clean, responsive design.
- **Backend (Node.js, Express.js)**: Processes user input, handles requests, and interacts with the machine learning model.
- **Machine Learning**: Generates personalized travel plans based on user data and historical travel patterns.
- **Database (MongoDB)** *(optional)*: Could be integrated for storing user data such as previous itineraries and feedback.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: For running the backend server.
- **Express.js**: For creating API endpoints to handle form submissions.
- **Material UI**: For styling the form and ensuring a responsive, modern design.
- **Machine Learning (Python Model)**: To generate travel itineraries.
- **MongoDB (optional)**: To store user data, feedback, or travel itineraries.

## How It Works

1. **User Inputs**: Users fill in details such as destination, budget, number of travelers, travel companions, travel style, and more.
2. **Data Processing**: The inputs are sent to the backend, where they are processed and fed into a machine learning model.
3. **Itinerary Generation**: Based on the input, the ML model generates a travel plan and sends it back to the frontend.
4. **Display**: The customized itinerary is displayed directly below the form, allowing users to view their plans instantly.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB (optional for future enhancements)
- Python (if the machine learning model is to be run separately)

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-planning-app.git
    cd travel-planning-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install both frontend and backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    # For backend
    cd backend
    npm install
    
    # For frontend
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Backend Server**:
    Start the Node.js backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

4. **Run the Frontend**:
    Start the React frontend:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the Application**:
    Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
